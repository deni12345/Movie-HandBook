# Movie-HandBook
<h2> Nodejs - mongodb -ejs -jwt</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This project is developed to help you to note all your favorite movies and also your favorite movie studios.</li>
  <li>In this project, I've used jwt for authentication.</li>
  <li>For the carousel, I've used slick slider.</li> 
  <li>For the image drag and drop area, I've use filepond to do it.</li>
  <li>When a user upload an image i will convert it to base64 and save it to the database, althought this is not a good solution (for a better solution you must use multer to store it on the severside folder or a cloud storage).</li>
  <li>I've also used ejs and nodejs to make a severside pagination too</li>
</ul>
